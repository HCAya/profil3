## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Theoretical Chemistry Institute](https://tci.chem.wisc.edu/) at University of Wisconsin–Madison, where I conduct research at the interface of molecular dynamics and machine learning under the supervision of [Prof. Xuhui Huang](https://huang.chem.wisc.edu/). Prior to my doctoral studies, I received a B.S. in Chemistry from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), where I worked on molecular docking methods in the group of [Prof. Yi Qin Gao](https://www.chem.pku.edu.cn/gaoyq/).

My research focuses on developing physics-informed AI methods for biochemical discovery, aiming to address the challenges that limit our understanding of complex molecular systems. In particular, I work on deep generative models that integrate statistical physics principles to enable molecular ensemble sampling. In parallel, I have several collaborations with experimental researchers in which I employ protein language models to facilitate protein design. 

My work draws on methods and ideas from machine learning, theoretical chemistry, and bioinformatics, and I believe that such interdisciplinary integration can spark scientific breakthroughs that go beyond well-defined problems.
